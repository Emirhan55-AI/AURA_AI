# Social Feature - UI to Domain Entity Connection Implementation

## Architecture Approach

The implementation follows Clean Architecture principles by creating a proper separation between the domain layer and presentation layer for the Social feature. This approach ensures that the UI can be changed independently of the data source (Supabase).

## Components Implemented

1. **SocialPostViewModel**
   - Acts as an adapter between domain entities and UI components
   - Maintains UI-specific properties like formatting, visual state, etc.
   - Provides conversion methods from domain entities to view models

2. **Updated SocialPostCard Widget**
   - Now works with the view model instead of directly with domain entities
   - Maintains the same UI and interactions but is now properly separated from data concerns

3. **Updated SocialPostsListView**
   - Converts domain entities to view models before displaying them
   - Properly handles pagination and refreshing from the real data source

4. **Enhanced SocialFeedController**
   - Added proper save functionality with local tracking of saved posts
   - Improved error handling with explicit types
   - Better state management for UI operations

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Domain entities represent the core business objects
   - View models adapt these for UI-specific needs
   - Widgets only need to know about view models, not domain structure

2. **Testability**
   - Each layer can be tested independently
   - Mock implementations can be easily substituted

3. **Maintainability**
   - Changes to the domain model won't break the UI
   - UI can evolve independently of the data source

4. **Compatibility**
   - New implementation preserves the same UI and interactions
   - Migration path is clear and doesn't require rewriting the UI

## Implementation Notes

- Used the Adapter pattern via view models to bridge domain and presentation
- Maintained optimistic updates for better user experience
- Added proper null handling for optional fields like images
- Extended functionality with save feature that can be expanded later

## Migration Path

To fully migrate the application:

1. Replace the old controllers with the new ones
2. Update imports in screens to use the new view models and widgets
3. Update any direct references to the old SocialPost model in the UI

This approach allows for a gradual migration with minimal disruption to the user experience.
