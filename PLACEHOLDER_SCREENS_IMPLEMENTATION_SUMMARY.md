# Placeholder Screens Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the creation of placeholder screens for the five main navigation tabs in the Aura Flutter application. These placeholder screens provide a foundation for the main application structure and will be replaced with fully functional screens during subsequent development phases.

## Directory Structure Created

The following feature directories and their `presentation/screens` subdirectories were verified/created:

1. **Home Feature**: `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/` ✅ (Already existed)
2. **Wardrobe Feature**: `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/screens/` ✅ (Created)
3. **Style Assistant Feature**: `lib/features/style_assistant/presentation/screens/` ✅ (Created)
4. **Social Feature**: `lib/features/social/presentation/screens/` ✅ (Created)
5. **User Profile Feature**: `lib/features/user_profile/presentation/screens/` ✅ (Created)

## Placeholder Screen Files Created

### 1. Home Screen
- **File**: `lib/features/home/presentation/screens/home_screen.dart`
- **Class**: `HomeScreen`
- **Icon**: `Icons.home_rounded` with primary theme color
- **Description**: "Welcome to your Aura dashboard"
- **Visual Theme**: Primary color scheme with circular container background

### 2. Wardrobe Home Screen
- **File**: `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/screens/wardrobe_home_screen.dart`
- **Class**: `WardrobeHomeScreen`
- **Icon**: `Icons.checkroom_rounded` with secondary theme color
- **Description**: "Manage your digital wardrobe"
- **Visual Theme**: Secondary color scheme with circular container background

### 3. Style Assistant Screen

- **Class**: `StyleAssistantScreen`
- **Icon**: `Icons.auto_awesome_rounded` with tertiary theme color
- **Description**: "Your AI-powered style companion"
- **Visual Theme**: Tertiary color scheme with circular container background

### 4. Social Feed Screen
- **File**: `lib/features/social/presentation/screens/social_feed_screen.dart`
- **Class**: `SocialFeedScreen`
- **Icon**: `Icons.people_rounded` with pink color
- **Description**: "Connect with the style community"
- **Visual Theme**: Pink color scheme with circular container background

### 5. User Profile Screen
- **File**: `lib/features/user_profile/presentation/screens/user_profile_screen.dart`
- **Class**: `UserProfileScreen`
- **Icon**: `Icons.person_rounded` with purple color
- **Description**: "Manage your personal settings"
- **Visual Theme**: Purple color scheme with circular container background

## Implementation Details

### Common Features Across All Placeholders:
- **Widget Type**: `StatelessWidget` for simplicity and performance
- **Layout**: Centered column layout with icon, title, and description
- **Material Design**: Utilizes Material 3 theming and design principles
- **Accessibility**: Proper text scaling and color contrast following theme guidelines
- **Visual Distinction**: Each screen uses unique icons and color schemes for easy identification

### Design Consistency:
- **Container Design**: 80x80 circular containers with theme-based background colors
- **Icon Size**: Consistent 40.0 size for all icons
- **Typography**: Uses theme-based text styles (`headlineMedium`, `bodyLarge`)
- **Spacing**: Consistent 24px spacing between icon and title, 8px between title and description
- **Color Opacity**: 0.1 opacity for background containers, 0.7 opacity for description text

## Integration Status

✅ **Ready for MainScreen Integration**: All placeholder screens are properly structured and named to match the expected class names for integration with the `MainScreen` tab switching logic.

✅ **Feature-First Architecture**: Follows the established feature-first directory structure for scalable development.

✅ **Theme Compliance**: All screens utilize the existing Aura theme for consistent visual presentation.

## Next Steps

1. **Integration**: These placeholder screens are ready to be integrated into the `MainScreen` tab navigation system.
2. **Development**: Each placeholder can be individually replaced with full-featured screens during the development process.
3. **Testing**: The simple structure allows for easy navigation testing and UI verification.

## Notes

- All files follow Flutter and Dart naming conventions
- Each screen is self-contained with no external dependencies beyond Flutter Material
- The placeholder design is intentionally simple to facilitate easy replacement
- Color schemes utilize both theme-based colors and distinct standard colors for visual variety
