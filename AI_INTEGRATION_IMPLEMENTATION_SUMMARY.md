  - `/docs` - GET endpoint for connectivity testing

**Key Features**:
- Image upload and processing for clothing analysis
- Style recommendation queries with user context
- Comprehensive error handling with Either pattern
- Network failure, validation error, and unknown error handling
- HTTP client abstraction for testability

**Data Models**:
- `ClothingAnalysisResult`: Category, colors, attributes, season, material, confidence
- `StyleRecommendationResult`: Recommendation text, outfit suggestions, tips, confidence
- `OutfitSuggestion`: Detailed outfit information with suitability scores

### 2. AddClothingItemScreen AI Integration
- **Location**: `lib/features/wardrobe/presentation/controllers/add_clothing_item_controller.dart`
- **Enhancement**: Replaced mock AI tagging with real service integration

**Features**:
- Automatic clothing analysis when users upload photos
- Category detection and mapping to app categories
- Color extraction and assignment
- Season and material detection
- Attribute tagging (casual, formal, sporty, etc.)
- Smart category mapping from AI results to app categories

**AI Category Mapping**:
```dart
'shirt' â†’ 'Tops'
'pants' â†’ 'Bottoms'
'dress' â†’ 'Dresses'
'shoes' â†’ 'Shoes'
'jacket' â†’ 'Outerwear'
// ... comprehensive mapping
```

### 3. StyleAssistantScreen AI Integration
- **Location**: `lib/features/style_assistant/presentation/controllers/style_assistant_controller.dart`
- **Enhancement**: Added real AI-powered style recommendations

**Features**:
- Text-based style queries with AI responses
- Image-based style analysis and advice
- Context-aware recommendations using chat history
- User preference integration (ready for future implementation)
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### 4. Riverpod Provider Integration
- **Location**: `lib/core/providers/service_providers.dart`
- **Provider**: `auraAiServiceProvider`
- **Code Generation**: Ready for `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`

### 5. AI Integration Test Screen
- **Location**: `lib/features/ai_integration/test/ai_integration_test_screen.dart`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing interface for AI functionality

**Test Features**:
- Connection testing to AI service
- Image upload and analysis testing
- Style recommendation query testing
- Real-time result display
- Error state visualization
- Performance monitoring

## API Integration Details

### Image Processing Endpoint
```dart
POST https://aura-one-sigma.vercel.app/process-image/
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

// Request: image file upload
// Response: ClothingAnalysisResult with category, colors, attributes, etc.
```

### Style Recommendation Endpoint
```dart
POST https://aura-one-sigma.vercel.app/get-recommendation/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_id": "current_user",
  "query": "What should I wear to a casual dinner?",
  "context": {
    "message_history": "...",
    "image_url": "...",
    "analysis_type": "..."
  }
}

// Response: StyleRecommendationResult with recommendation, tips, outfits
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Network Failures
- Connection timeouts
- No internet connectivity
- Server unavailability
- HTTP error status codes

### Validation Failures
- Invalid response format
- Missing required fields
- Malformed JSON responses
- File upload errors

### User Experience
- Loading states during AI processing
- Graceful error recovery
- Retry mechanisms
- Informative error messages

## Code Quality Features

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive null safety
- Strong typing with generic Either pattern
- Immutable data models
- Compile-time error checking

### Clean Architecture
- Separation of concerns
- Repository pattern ready
- Dependency injection with Riverpod
- Testable service layer

### Performance Optimization
- HTTP client reuse
- Efficient JSON parsing
- Memory-conscious file handling
- Background processing support
