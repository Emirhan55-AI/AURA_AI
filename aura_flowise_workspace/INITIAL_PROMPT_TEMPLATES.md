## Usage Instructions for Flowise

1. **Copy Template Content**: Copy the template structure (the text within the code blocks) from any template above
2. **Create Prompt Template Node**: In Flowise, add a "Prompt Template" node to your chatflow
3. **Paste Template**: Paste the copied template content into the template field
4. **Configure Variables**: Set up the placeholder variables (e.g., {{screen_name}}, {{feature_name}}) as input variables in Flowise
5. **Connect to LLM**: Connect the prompt template output to your Claude Sonnet 4 chat model node
6. **Test and Iterate**: Test the template with sample inputs and refine as needed

## Template Maintenance

These templates should be regularly updated to reflect:
- Changes in project architecture or coding standards
- New Flutter/Dart language features
- Updates to dependencies (Riverpod, Material 3, etc.)
- Lessons learned from generated code quality

For template updates, modify this file and update the corresponding Flowise configurations.
