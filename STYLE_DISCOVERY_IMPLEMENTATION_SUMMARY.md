# Style Discovery Implementation for Onboarding Flow

## Overview

The Style Discovery component is a critical part of the Aura onboarding process that collects user style preferences through a gamified, chat-like interface. This information is essential for initializing the user's AI stylist profile and providing personalized recommendations.

## Implementation Details

### Files Created

1. **Main Screen:**
   - `lib/features/authentication/presentation/screens/onboarding/style_discovery_screen.dart`
   
2. **Custom Widgets:**
   - `lib/features/authentication/presentation/widgets/onboarding/style_discovery/onboarding_chat_interface.dart`
   - `lib/features/authentication/presentation/widgets/onboarding/style_discovery/preference_question_card.dart`
   - `lib/features/authentication/presentation/widgets/onboarding/style_discovery/answer_option_widget.dart`

### Key Components

#### StyleDiscoveryScreen

The main screen that orchestrates the style discovery process, featuring:
- Progress indicator to show how many questions have been answered
- Chat interface for displaying questions and answers
- Input area for collecting user responses
- Loading and error states using SystemStateWidget
- Skip button for bypassing the style discovery process

#### OnboardingChatInterface

A chat-like interface that:
- Displays AI questions and user answers in a conversation view
- Auto-scrolls to the latest message
- Shows a welcome message
- Displays a typing indicator when the AI is "thinking"
- Visualizes different answer types appropriately

#### PreferenceQuestionCard

A chat bubble for AI messages that:
- Displays questions with appropriate styling
- Shows visual aids for specific question types (color samples, image upload placeholders)
- Has special styling for the welcome message

#### AnswerOptionWidget

A versatile input widget that adapts to different answer types:
- Text input with send button
- Single choice selection using FilterChips
- Multi-choice selection with confirmation button
- Image upload button
- Color picker with visual selection

### Data Models

Simple data classes for UI structure:
- `StylePreference`: Represents a style-related question with type and options
- `UserStyleAnswer`: Represents the user's answer to a question
- `AnswerType`: Enum for different types of answers (single choice, multi-choice, etc.)

### User Flow

1. User arrives at the StyleDiscoveryScreen after previous onboarding steps
2. Screen shows a welcome message from the AI assistant
3. AI asks questions one by one about style preferences
4. User provides answers through the appropriate input method
5. Progress indicator updates as questions are answered
6. After all questions are answered, user proceeds to the login screen
7. User can skip the process at any time

### UI States

- **Initial Loading**: Shows a SystemStateWidget with loading animation
- **Error State**: Shows a SystemStateWidget with retry option
- **Empty State**: Shows welcome message and first question
- **AI Typing**: Shows animated typing indicator
- **User Input**: Shows appropriate input controls based on question type

## Design Compliance

- Follows Material 3 design principles with Aura's warm and personal styling
- Uses consistent chat bubble design similar to StyleAssistantScreen
- Implements Atomic Design components for reusability
- Features responsive layout that works across device sizes
- Uses the app's color scheme consistently for visual harmony

## Next Steps

1. Connect the UI to a Riverpod controller/service
2. Implement actual data storage for collected preferences
3. Integrate with the user profile creation process
4. Add animations and transitions for a more polished experience
5. Implement actual image upload and processing
6. Add accessibility features for inclusive design
